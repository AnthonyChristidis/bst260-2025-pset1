# Problem Set 1: Unix, Quarto, and RStudio Projects

## Overview

This assignment introduces you to RStudio projects, Quarto documents, Unix commands, and file organization. You'll work with quadratic equations, create plots, and practice using command-line tools.

## Getting Started

1.  **Accept the assignment** via the GitHub Classroom link
2.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine
3.  **Open the repository folder** in RStudio as a project
4.  **Complete all problems** in the `pset-01-unix-quarto.qmd` file

## Assignment Files

-   `pset-01-unix-quarto.qmd` - Main assignment file with all problems
-   `README.md` - This instruction file

## What You'll Create

By the end of this assignment, your repository should contain:

**Root Directory:**

-   `pset-01-unix-quarto.qmd` - Main assignment file
-   `beginning.qmd` - Created in Problem 1

**Directories to Create:**

-   `img/`
    -   `screenshot.png` - Your RStudio screenshot (Problem 2)
-   `docs/`
    -   `beginning.pdf` - Rendered PDF (Problem 5)
-   `data/`
    -   `coefs.txt` - Coefficient file (Problem 7)
-   `code/`
    -   `quadratic.qmd` - Copy of beginning.qmd (Problem 8)

## Instructions

1.  **Work through each problem** in order in the `pset-01-unix-quarto.qmd` file
2.  **Follow the naming conventions** specified in each problem
3.  **Include all commands** you use in the designated code blocks
4.  **Test that your files render** before submitting

## Technical Requirements

-   Use **relative paths** when reading files (unless specifically asked for absolute paths)
-   Include **all Unix commands** you use
-   Make sure your **Quarto documents render** without errors
-   Take **screenshots** as requested

## Submission

Your submission is your final committed and pushed repository. Make sure to:

1.  **Complete all problems** in the assignment file
2.  **Commit your changes** frequently with meaningful messages
3.  **Push your final work** to GitHub
4.  **Verify** that all files are visible in your GitHub repository
